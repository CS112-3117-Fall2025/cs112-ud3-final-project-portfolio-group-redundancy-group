# Unit Deliverable 3 - Final Project

The name of our project is Minesweeper, or Minsweeper Replica. We originally decided to attempt at replicating minesweeper because we all wanted to try and make an interactive game that we could use and play with, as we thought that a game would be easier to come up with ideas for than a program for a specific personal need. 

The way the game works is pretty simple, with the user clicking the play button and then being brought to a difficulty screen. Depending on what difficulty the user picks, the playing board will either be bigger or smaller. Additionally, the amount of mines will proportionately increase to make the concentration of mines even greater, when compared to the total area of the playing board. The board is made up of individual cells that can either be clicked with the left mouse button to uncover them, or clicked with the right mouse button to mark them with a flag, after which they cannot be uncovered until the flag is removed. The placement of the mines is entirely random, and their location can be indicated by the uncovered, numbered cells, which will tell the user how many mines have been detected in the 8 surrounding cells to that specific cell.

The win and lose conditions are relatively simple. If the user reveals a 'mine' or 'bomb', then they lose the game. However, if the user sucessfully avoids all of the mines, then they will win the game.
